# Kubefront - Simple cluster management

**Project vision**

Kubefront is a dashboard for Kubernetes clusters that simplifies cluster management. The development of kubefront is taking place as a part of a course in advanced web programming at Link√∂ping University. Kubefront allows an administratior to manage and monitor the cluster. Kubefront can be safely exposed publicly and be used by people with limited knowledge of Kubernetes.

**Functional requirements**

*User can*

- [x] Run Kubefront and access the Web UI
- [x] Basic auth system and ability to sign in as administrator
- [ ] Create manage and delete other user accounts
- [ ] See basic statistics from the cluster
- [ ] Live data for statistics
- [ ] See and manage running pods
- [ ] See and manage running deployments
- [ ] See and manage services
- [ ] See and manage ingresses


**Technological specification**

- Vue is used on the client side. All client-side programming is made in JavaScript and packed in Webpack as part of standard Vue procedures. View components are split when relevant.
- Go is used as the backend programming language acting as an authenticator and mediator between the client-side and Kubernetes API. Because authentication is built into the backend the backend can safely be exposed outside the cluster.
- The backend runs in a Docker container. It can connect to a cluster from within the cluster or externally through the Kubernetes API. Because of this it can be run locally and be connected to a remote cluster. 
- Custom built bash scripts to simplify building, running, deploying and testing kubefront will be made.
- Kubefront workers (go routines launced from the Kubefront API) will be used to make async tasks for the user.
- Live communication with clients using websockets.

The image below explains how the Kubefront architecture looks like.
